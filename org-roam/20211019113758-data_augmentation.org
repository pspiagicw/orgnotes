#+title: Data Augmentation
* Data Augmentation
  This is a method where you try to change data so that the model can get more information out of data.
  This can include simply rotating or cropping the image in [[id:72b7cecb-8c60-4be0-888c-245a23865bff][Convulutional Neural Network]] .
  This allows us for making the model harder to learn , thus it only learns the important things
  preventing the model from [[id:95d76645-2ade-4dfa-b4e4-adc4583a2952][Overfitting]] .
  This also allows us to make new data using existing data , useful when training data is very low.
