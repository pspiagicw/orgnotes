* Beautiful Day
  I captured today's DAA notes in Org-Roam.
  I also tried to capture NLP notes in Org-Roam , as module 3 started!

  My flutter installation is working perfectly now and even android-studio works with it

  Today a meeting with Vishwas was scheduled , but he did not share the meeting link.
* Really Good!
  Flutter installation confirmed!
