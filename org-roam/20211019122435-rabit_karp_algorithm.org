#+title: Rabit Karp Algorithm
* Rabin Karp Algorithm
  This algorithm calculates the hash value for the pattern , as well for each M-charachter subsequence of text to be compared.
  If hash value unequal , the algorithm will determine the hash value for next M-character sequence.
  If equal , algorithm will analyze the pattern and M-character sequence.
