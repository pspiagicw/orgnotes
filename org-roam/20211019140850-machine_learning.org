#+title: Machine Learning
* Machine Learning
  Art of designing algorithm that change their output
  dynamically for the same input using the input itself.

  Or designing algorithms that can improve themselves
  through experience with their inputs.(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html).
  Features:
  - Adapting
    Adapts to data changes
  - Learning
    Learn things that are hard to code
  - Discovering
    Invisible relations in data , basically [[id:fc073563-8970-4184-a549-5583397c2358][Data Mining]]

** Types of Machine Learning
   
*** Learning
    They are divided based on whether input and outputs are both given or not.

*** Rate of Learning
    This is divided using how the data is given to the model
