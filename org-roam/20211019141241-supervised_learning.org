#+title: Supervised Learning
* Supervised Learning
  A techique where both the input(features) and labels(output) are given to the model.
  The model can determine the relation between both of them essentially becoming a [[id:d758f120-db0a-4e66-8cf0-d39b887d7634][Mathematical Model]] .

  Think of them as our parents , which will give the problem and their solutions
  The models includes
