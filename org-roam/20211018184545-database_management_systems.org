* Database Management Systems
** DBMS: Database Management System
   Consist of 2 parts
   * Data: Invidisual piece of information that cannot be broken down.Raw facts that provides no standalone meaning.
   * Information: Processed or organized or interrelated data
   * Database: Collection of interrelated data
   * Management: Set of rules and procedures which helps to create , organize and manipulate.
** DBMS Applications
   * Banking
   * Airlines
   * Universities
   * Sales
   * HR
   * Manufacturing
** What is DBMS ?
   Collection of interrelated data and set of programs to access those data
   To provide a environment that is both convinient and efficient to use for retrieving data
** Examples
   * MySQL
   * MariaDB
   * OracleDB
** Alternative to Database systems
*** File Management Systems
    Store permament records in various files
    Requires different programs to extract records from and add records.
    Drawbacks:
    * No ACID properties
    * No redundancy
    * Security problems.
** Difference
    | A file system is a software that manages and organizes files in a storage medium. It controls how data is stored and retrieved | DBMS is a software application. It is used for accessing , creating and managing databases |
    | The files system provides the details of data representation and storage of data                                               | DBMS gives an abstract view of data that hides the details                                 |
    | Storing and retrieving of data can't be done efficiently                                                                       | DBMS is efficient in storing and retrieve data                                             |
    | It does not offer data recovery processes                                                                                      | This is backup recovery for data in DBMS                                                   |
    | The file system doesn't have a crash recovery mechanism                                                                        | DBMS offers good protection mechanism                                                      |
    | Protecting a file system is very difficult                                                                                     | DBMS provides crash recovery system                                                        |
    | Reduncancy is greater                                                                                                          | Redundancy low                                                                             |
    | Inconsistent                                                                                                                   | Low inconsistency                                                                        |
** Data Abstraction
   They are made up of complex data structures , to ease the user interaction developers hide internal irrelevant details
*** Physical Level
    * Lowest level of abstraction
    * Actual storage of data on the disk.
    * How the data is stored
*** Logical Level
    * Shows what data is stored.
    * What relationship exists among the database
*** View Level
