#+title: String Matching Algorithm
* String Matching Algorithm
  The string matching algorithm matches a given text array [1...n] of n characters and pattern array P[1..m] of m characters.
  The problem are to find an integers , called valid shift , where 0 <= s < n -m and T[s+1...s+m] = P[1...m]
  In other words to find whether P is a substring of T

  Item of P and T are character drawn from finite alphabet set such as {A,B....Z,a,b...z}

  Substring of T is represented as T[i..j].

  We need to find [[id:fe347697-24ad-462e-861e-688433358bf3][Proper Substring]] in most cases or a normal substring as described above.

  The algorithms used for string matching are
