* Russel's Observation
  Russel observed that if sets are defined by properties of their members , some sets will turn out to be
  members of themselves and others will not.
  Example: Set of all elephants is not itself an element , thus not a member of itself.
  But set of all abstract concepts must contain itself as member , since a set is an abstract concept.

  Properties 'is a member of iteself' and 'not a member of itself' must be defined
