* Neural Networks
  Neural Networks / Artificial Neural Network are collection of nodes also called /Neurons/.
  Based on the structure of neurons in the human brain.

  These nodes are small [[id:d758f120-db0a-4e66-8cf0-d39b887d7634][Mathematical Model]] , which are arranged in a forms of layers can solve non-linear problems.
  They are combined with [[id:78159c65-5c74-4c2a-bcfc-3f3d6f1b098f][Activation Functions]]  , to provide [[id:629631b7-3a02-4042-90ed-747ed5a5bf17][Black Box Analysis]] .

  They can solve multiple problems including NLP , Sound Analysis and photo analysis etc.
