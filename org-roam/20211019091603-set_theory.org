* Set Theory
  Set is an abstract collection of distinct object which are called the members or elements of that set.
  Set theory  puts no such restriction on sets , a set can be formed out of elements that have no connection
  whatsoever
** Notation
   Capital Letters used to denote the set itself. Small italic lower-case letters used to denote indivisual objects.

   To specify a object is in a set we use $ a \in B $
