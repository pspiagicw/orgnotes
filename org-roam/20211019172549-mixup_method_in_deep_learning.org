#+title: MixUp Method in Deep Learning
* MixUp
  This is a technique of [[id:3ef92603-db90-4b5a-b450-a292630ef4fc][Data Augmentation]]  ,where a [[id:b675d9e2-7d7b-48ef-b750-478e69017a80][Neural Network]]  on convex combinations
  of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so mixup regularizes the neural network to favour linear
  behaviour in-between training examples (https://github.com/facebookresearch/mixup-cifar10).
  GitHub repository https://github.com/facebookresearch/mixup-cifar10.

  In simple words two inputs and their outputs are mixed together,
  they are mixed in such a way that the model understands both the inputs simultaenously.

  The input are mixed using
  \begin{equation}
  \vec{x} = \lambda x_i + ( 1- \lambda ) X_j
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  \vec{y} = \lambda y_i + ( 1- \lambda ) y_j
  \end{equation}
  $\lambda$ is independent for each augmented example.
