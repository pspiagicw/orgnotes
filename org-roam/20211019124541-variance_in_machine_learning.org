#+title: Variance
* Variance in Machine Learning
  This is when the model performs significantly differently when the training dataset is changed.
  This means the model is not contrained enough and is overfitting the dataset.
  The models that have high variance are KNN , Random Forest , Decision Tree.
  These model does not have a internal state independent from the data , thus has high variance.
