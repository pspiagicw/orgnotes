#+title: Ramdom Eraser Method in Deep Learning
* Random Eraser Method
  This method is for [[id:3ef92603-db90-4b5a-b450-a292630ef4fc][Data Augmentation]]  where we delete random contigous rectangles out of the picture.
  These rectangles are selected using probablity and mathematical rules.
  They can improve the model's ability to identify objects in the data.
