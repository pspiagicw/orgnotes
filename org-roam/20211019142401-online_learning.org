  This type of model takes input incrementally continously ,
  this model can adapt to data quickly. This is also useful as
  we can distribute this work over multiple computers and allow
  for changes on the model while in use.

  This also allows to train if the data does not fit in memory.([[id:e8d1a84b-d816-4869-8458-e284f712b410][Out of Core Learning]])
